# An-Entity-to-3D-Model-Prototype-From-a-Photo-PW23_NVP_02

This project aims to develop a prototype that converts a 2D photo of an entity into a 3D model representation. 
The objective is to leverage computer vision and machine learning techniques to generate a realistic and accurate 3D model from a single input image.

Introduction

In this project, we explore the field of computer vision and 3D modeling to create a prototype capable of generating a 3D model from a photograph.
The motivation behind this project is to provide a tool that simplifies the process of creating 3D models, especially for objects or entities that are
difficult or time-consuming to model manually.

The prototype utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to extract key features and depth information from the 2D image. Machine learning techniques 
are then employed to reconstruct the geometry and texture of the entity, resulting in a realistic 3D representation.
