This project endeavors to transform 2D facial images into detailed 3D prototypes through advanced feature extraction and modeling techniques. 
The resulting 3D models are then translated into G-code for practical applications in product design, architectural visualization, and game development. 
By innovatively bridging the gap between 2D imagery and 3D representation.

The project aims to develop an automated image processing system that performs several key tasks related to facial recognition, 3D modeling, and 3D printing.
This system is designed to take an uploaded image as input and then execute a series of steps to ultimately produce a 3D-printable model.
Here's a breakdown of the primary components of the project:

1. Facial Recognition and Extraction     
2. 3D Face Modeling        
3. 3D Printing Preparation

Facial Recognition and Extraction:
    The first part of the project involves using facial recognition algorithms to identify and extract faces from the uploaded image.
These recognized faces are then categorized and stored in respective folders based on the person they belong to.

3D Face Modeling:
    Once the faces are extracted, the system employs an algorithm to create a 3D model of a solid bald head from the 2D facial image.
This involves converting the 2D representation into a 3D model in STL (STereoLithography) format, which is commonly used for 3D printing.

3D Printing Preparation:
    The resulting 3D model in STL(STereoLithography) format is then processed by the CuraEngine tool. 
CuraEngine is used to convert the 3D model into G-code, a language that 3D printers understand.
This step involves slicing the 3D model into layers and generating the instructions required for the 3D printer to produce the physical object.
